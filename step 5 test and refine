1.	Pet consumes food as expected :
(Output) Food distributed , bowl weight increases, no alert
Result: the system works correctly. Sensor detects change in weight and alert is not sent.
2.	Pet doesn’t eat:
(output) Weight doesn’t change, alert sent 
Result: food dispensed and sensor detects no change in weight so the alert is sent. Hence, the system works correctly.
3.	Food doesn’t dispensed:
